This is a plugin to help put up FAQ lists on Wordpress pages in an easy manner. Multiple options are provided to allow different variations.

== Description ==
This is a simple plugin to help users put up FAQ lists on their site. Most FAQ plugins only allow a single format (usually the Accordion) format to put up FAQ lists. While that is great there are a number of folks who would rather just have simple bookmark tags to list their Questions at the top and lead to Answers below. This plugin attempts to provide an easy to use solution for such scenarios.

Options available are:
<ol>
<li>Accordion (the default option)</li>
<li>Simple (just list each answer below that question)</li>
<li>Bookmarks (show the questions at the top and lead to the related answer below)</li>
</ol>
